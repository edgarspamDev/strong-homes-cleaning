# Competitor Comparison: NWI Market

| Competitor | Emphasis | Weakness | How Strong Homes Beats Them |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spekless** | Tech-forward, Instant pricing, slick UI. | Can feel impersonal/robotic. "Uber for cleaning." | **Local Soul:** We use real photos of NWI (or generic local-feeling ones) and emphasize "Your Neighbors" while matching their slick quote form. |
| **MaidPro** | 49-Point Checklist, Branding. | Franchise bloat. Generic corporate copy. | **Simplicity:** "The Strong Homes Standard" (Clean what needs cleaning) vs rigid corporate checklists. More flexibility. |
| **The Cleaning Authority** | "Rotation System" (Deep clean zones). | Confusing for simple needs. Upsell heavy. | **Directness:** We offer "Deep Clean" or "Standard". No complex rotation math. Better for one-off/move-outs. |
| **Truly Fresh** | Training, "Certified". | Site often dated or cluttered. | **Clarity & Speed:** Our site loads instantly. The video hero builds immediate premium trust that clunky local sites lack. |

## Winning Angle for Strong Homes
"The reliability of a big franchise with the care of a local neighbor."
